# AVR-Ethernet

5/31/2015

This project is meant to be the 'big kid' version of the popular <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Ethernet_Shield_V2.0">Arduino Ethernet Shield</a>. 

The code is being initially developed on an Arduino Uno with the V2 ethernet shield. Once the project is in a functional 
design concept state, custom hardware will be designed and added to the repo.
